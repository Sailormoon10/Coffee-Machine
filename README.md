# Coffee-Machine

This program asks the user what drink they want. User selects one of three options: espresso, latte, or cappuccino
The user then inputs the amount of coins needed to pay and the program processes the payment.
A refund is given if funds are insufficient or exceeds the cost. 
Cost of the drink is then added to the 'profit'.
User is asked if they want another drink, and the program loops agai.

If the user types 'off' the machine shuts off. 
If report is the input, the program outputs current resources and profit.
